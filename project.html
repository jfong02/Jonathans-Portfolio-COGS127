        <p>We utilized a mixture of survey and interviews, which helped us gain a general overview of rider needs while
          diving deep to obtain more anecdotal response that may uncover pain points and breakdowns. Responses and
          interviews were obtained from riders as well as drivers, as drivers have a vast level of exposure to several
          riders and may be able to identify certain trends among their riders.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row no-margin line-height-2a5">
        <p>After collecting feedback from user research, we discovered several findings that helped guide our eventual
          problem statement. One major finding was that people do not like being forced into a conversation or feel like
          they must talk with their driver. Rather, organic conversation is much more preferred. Furthermore, although
          there was a sizeable chance that conversation could lead to a negative ride experience, conversation was much
          more likely to turn a ridesharing experience into a positive experience. Based on our user research, we came
          up with the following problem statement.</p>

          <p>Lyft riders need a way to better notify their drivers of their preferences and expectations regarding
            conversation, comfort, accessibility and service throughout the ride-sharing experience. There must be
            non-intrusive application tweaks that will significantly increase the quality of communication, trust, and
            overall ride satisfaction between both parties and increase brand equity.</p>

                  and even sometimes to campus. He usually does not initiate conversation in public scenarios partly due
                  to the fact that he is still learning English, but still can have a great time chatting with other
                  people so that he can learn things about his new environment and practice the language. Kiro also does
                  not have the best constitution and could get sick easily if he does not dress properly or the
                  temperature is too high or too low. </h6>

          <p>With our primary research complete, we set out to formulate potential solutions. After collaborating
            together as a team, we discussed potential approaches, and eventually narrowed down our solutions to four
            areas in the UX flow we wanted to revise, which we created in Figma. These included language and
            accessibility, conversation and
            clothing options, mid-drive options, and a contextual feedback system.</p>

          <div class="col-6 no-margin line-height-2a5">
            <p><u>Entry Point 1</u></p>
            <p>Our primary goal here was to add accessibility information to better communicate with the driver. We also
              felt that adding a language area would help to communicate to the driver the rider's preferred means of
              communication and any difficulty the rider may have communicating to the driver.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6 no-margin line-height-2a5">
            <p><u>Entry Point 3</u></p>
            <p>For our more sensitive users, we created an in-ride panel of options to adjust some of their desired car
              environments. This could also apply to those who did not desire conversation, yet would still be able to
              communicate to their driver in specific ways.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-6 no-margin line-height-2a5">
            <p><u>Entry Point 2</u></p>
            <p>Some responses from our user research indicated that different levels of conversation may result in a
              better ride experience. We developed this feature so that the rider would be able to make the decision of
              how much they would be willing to talk, which would improve ride quality. Additionally, we also included a
              clothing option tab and a special request box so that the rider could better communicate to their driver
              who they were when being picked up, as well as any special requests they might have. All these features
              woud ideally be optional for the rushed user.</p>

          <div class="col-6 no-margin line-height-2a5">
            <p><u>Entry Point 4</u></p>
            <p>The catalyst for this area of redesign was based on our user research, where we asked users to describe
              their most positive or negative experiences using a rideshare application. We realized that this
              information would be extremely useful to potential riders, but the 5-star rating alone could not
              sufficiently communicate this information. To resolve this issue, we wanted to include a contextual rating
              system that would better communicate both to drivers and riders a more holistic ride experience, whether
              it be a positive or negative experience.</p>

        <p>Once we had a baseline understanding of where our redesigns might need to be implemented, we began discussing
          what the UI skeleton might contain. I set out to create a preliminary basic ui sketches by hand for fast
          prototyping, which we were able to utilize to further develop our design.</p>
        <p>Our main focus in the UI sketches was to replicate the current design scheme while adding additional avenues
          of communication between the user and driver.</p>
