          <p>After collecting feedback from user research, we discovered several findings that helped guide our eventual
            problem statement. One major finding was that people do not like being forced into a conversation or feel
            like they must talk with their driver. Rather, organic conversation is much more preferred. Furthermore,
            although there was a sizeable chance that conversation could lead to a negative ride experience,
            conversation was much more likely to turn a ridesharing experience into a positive experience. Based on our
            user research, we came up with the following problem statement.</p>

            <p>Lyft riders need a way to better notify their drivers of their preferences and expectations regarding
              conversation, comfort, accessibility and service throughout the ride-sharing experience. There must be
              non-intrusive application tweaks that will significantly increase the quality of communication, trust, and
              overall ride satisfaction between both parties and increase brand equity.</p>

            <p>With our primary research complete, we set out to formulate potential solutions. After collaborating

              <i>Entry Points</i> in the UX flow we wanted to redesign, which was created in Figma. These included
              language and accessibility, conversation and clothing options, mid-drive options, and a contextual

              <p>Our primary goal here was to add accessibility information to better communicate with the driver. We
                also felt that adding a language area would help to communicate to the driver the rider's preferred
                means of communication and any difficulty the rider may have communicating to the driver.</p>

              <p><u>Entry Point 3</u></p>
              <p>For our more sensitive users, we created an in-ride panel of options to adjust some of their desired
                car environments. This could also apply to those who did not desire conversation, yet would still be
                able to communicate to their driver in specific ways.</p>

              <p>Some responses from our user research indicated that different levels of conversation may result in a
                better ride experience. We developed this feature so that the rider would be able to make the decision
                of how much they would be willing to talk, which would improve ride quality. Additionally, we also
                included a clothing option tab and a special request box so that the rider could better communicate to
                their driver who they were when being picked up, as well as any special requests they might have. All
                these features woud ideally be optional for the rushed user.</p>

              <p>The catalyst for this area of redesign was based on our user research, where we asked users to describe
                their most positive or negative experiences using a rideshare application. We realized that this
                information would be extremely useful to potential riders, but the 5-star rating alone could not
                sufficiently communicate this information. To resolve this issue, we wanted to include a contextual
                rating
                system that would better communicate both to drivers and riders a more holistic ride experience, whether
                it be a positive or negative experience.</p>

          <p>In Entry Point 1, our goal was to make design choices that would be low-impact and seamlessly connect with
            the current profile page UI of Lyft. We added additional accessibility impairment toggles and a new language
            section, where you could select your preferred language to communicate in, as well as a scale for the user's

            was
            based on a pop-up functionality, which would have overlayed windows to display the options for each new
            feature. The 3 main features added were a conversation level setting, a clothing setting to communicate to
            the
            driver what the user would be wearing for easy pickup, and a special request box.</p>

          <p>Entry Point 3 was completely built with communication issues of the user in mind. We wanted to provide a
            way
            for the user to communicate with the driver if verbal communication was, for some reason, interrupted. This
            could be on the user side if they had a hearing impairment or had trouble verbally communicating with the
            driver, or if the user didn’t want to converse with the driver, but still had information they would like to
            communicate with the driver. These options would be available to the user during the ride based on their
            needs: add a stop, roll up/down the windows, change the A/C, adjust the music volume, or modify the level of
            conversation between the user and the driver.</p>

          <p>Entry Point 4 was also the second area of our redesign with 2 versions to compare between. In this entry
            point, we utilized a label-based rating system to replace the current 5-star rating, and included both
            positive and negative labels. We chose to use label-based choices to make this rating system faster and
            easier
            to fill out. Our A/B versions differed by essentially making version A combine all parts of the post-trip
            menu
            into one full-height screen, whereas version B would have a 2 part menu, where one would be ratings and the
            second payment details.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">With one person acting as the "computer" to manipulate the paper screens while
            performing A/B testing, we were able to identify the main takeaways for our redesign.</p>
          <p>Overall, our redesign was met with generally positive responses, with only slight confusion shown in a
            couple areas. Our A/B testing yielded interesting insights that we may utilize to improve the UI of each of
            the entry points. In all our designs, the main trend was that the design must be inclusive, require little
            cognitive effort to understand and use, and clear and direct.</p>
          <!-- <p><u>Entry Point 1</u> experienced the fewest problems with our participants. All our testers were able to
            quickly and effectively navigate and utilize the new feature. This indicated that this feature would be an
            effective feature to include with minimal redesign, and would help with communicating such vital and
            specific information to drivers ahead of time without supplementary user interaction.</p>
          <p><u>Entry Point 2</u> had mixed feedback, with 2/3 testers preferring version B for its simple, clean, and
            easy to use layout. One tester mentioned how color-blindness could be a potential problem with version B's
            clothing color slider, and our female tester raised the issue of whether there was a way to change the
            shorts to a skirt. This showed us that we needed to implement more inclusive or gender-neutral clothing
            icons. Furthermore, all participants had positive responses to the conversation setting, although one
            mentioned that they would like to see a larger range of options. Overall, our main takeaways for Entry Point
            2 was that what we design must be inclusive, simple and easy to use, and clear/direct.</p>
          <p><u>Entry Point 3</u> received generally positive responses, with the main gripes to fix being relatively
            minor. One key user feedback was that in general, the music settings would be used the most, with the least
            being the communication setting, most likely since the rider had already set this before they got into the
            car. The features on the page may also need to be clearer and more well defined if implemented.</p>
          <p><u>Entry Point 4</u>'s revamp was very well accepted. There was little confusion in the rating system, and
            interestingly, none of the participants questioned where the 5-star rating had gone, which demonstrates the
            viability of the labeled rating system as being equally, if not more, effective than the 5-star rating,
            though further testing may be required to verify this. The A/B versions were slightly more mixed, with a
            majority citing version B as being better for separating personal info from the payment, as well as reducing
            the potential of priming the tipping behavior. Most likely, we will combine the best of the two versions.

              and
              revamped it to match the Lyft theme, which was a vast improvement. In addition, we noticed that some of

            <p>Three new buttons are added to the page when the driver is en route to pick up the passenger. A clothing
              option for the users to select their current color of clothes, a chat preference option for them to select

        <p>Throughout the course of the design process, I have been able to sharpen my design skills even more. I again
          had a fresh realization of the importance of user research in design, particularly when tackling a real-world
          problem with many implications and nuances. Without a proper grounding in the understanding of user needs, it
          is impossible to appropriately design for that specific user, and this class has taught me this valuable
          lesson. Now looking back, I realize that despite the many good ideas this redesign brings, this redesign could
          have been approached with a different lens. I found that during the whole process, I was constantly trying to
          ideate and figure out ways of redesigning several pain points throughout the app, instead of than focusing on
          a single pain point and making sure it sticks the landing. Although the features developed here may have been
          with good intent, looking back on it, I am not certain whether people would be willing to use our features.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row no-margin margin-tb-2 line-height-2">
        <p>The final redesign created throughout this project should not be considered an ending point. Rather, it ought
          to be only the first step to further redesign and development. In further redesigns of this proposed solution,
          I would consider designing more closely aligned towards more singular solutions, rather than this project's
          more expansive reach into the Lyft UX flow. I realized it is easier to define a single feature rather than a
          group of features, and addressing every deficient area in the app simultaneously may spread the design team
          too thinly to appropriately address each problem space. Although this final redesign is a good step towards
          the right direction in improving communication among ridesharing services, more detailed redesign may be
          needed to fully flesh out each part of the app. In the future, I fully intend to take the lessons learned from
          this app and not design for the sake of design, but rather design with the intent of designing something that
          the
          users would be more willing and even happy to use.</p>
